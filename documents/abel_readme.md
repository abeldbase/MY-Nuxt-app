what I learned about SEO & analytics:
SEO stands for search engine optimization. SEO practitioners optimize websites, web pages and content for the purposes of ranking higher in search engines, like Google. SEO is a set of practices designed to improve the appearance, positioning, and usefulness of multiple types of content in the organic search results. This content can include web pages, video media, images, local business listings, and other assets. Because organic search is the top method via which people discover and access online content, utilizing SEO best practices is essential for ensuring that the digital content you publish can be found and chosen by the public, increasing websiteâ€™s organic traffic.

A significant reason that SEO matters is because it helps online publishers appear within the results displayed by search engines. Search engines like Google and Bing each have their own methods of surfacing and formatting the content they display when a user enters a query into a search box
Investing in SEO includes engaging in customer research, market research, and keyword research so that web content reflects the language real people use to search for whatever website offers. The findings of research can then be incorporated into optimization of multiple elements of website and its pages
